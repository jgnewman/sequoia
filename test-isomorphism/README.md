# How to test

- `cd` into this folder and run `$ node iso`
- This will compile the test app into `iso-compiled.js` and start a server listening on port 8080.
- The iso app should render different content for `/`, `/about`, and any other path.
- The iso client side should render additional data for the `/` path that has been preloaded.
