  - [x] Easy addition of more Middleware
  - [x] Automatic state saving?
- [x] Configure the app for things like state saving and use of redux dev tools
- [x] Router
  - [x] Anywhere you are going to have Routes, wrap them in a Router. This can be nested in whatever way.
  - [x] Every route is associated with a location or maybe a function that returns true when it should render.
  - [x] Every route is associated with a component to render.
  - [x] Every instance of router should only render 1 of its children under any circumstance.
  - [x] Nested instances of router should be able to care only about sub paths
- [x] Easier actions
- [x] Data layer
- [x] test requestThunk, ok, notok
- [x] Allow data api to work when state has not been configured
- [x] Allow infuseActions/Binders/Modules to include a single prop by name or a whole pack
- [x] Make sure components update when data comes through
- [x] Constants
- [x] write tests
- [x] change infuseValues to infuseState
- [x] allow multiple apps on one page
- [ ] Why is react-pathway calling render on its child twice??
- [ ] update live reloader with something that works with node 7
- [x] queriable.countWhere
- [x] queriable.updateWhere
- [x] queriable.subtractWhere
